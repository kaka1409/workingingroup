              For a time, desire consumed my life. I wasn’t just chasing
              physical pleasure; I was driven by an insatiable hunger that I
              believed would make me feel whole. I was constantly searching for
              relationships and encounters, believing that they would fill the
              void inside me. But no matter how deeply I indulged, the
              satisfaction was always fleeting, leaving me empty and regretful.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              I remember going through many relationships, younger to older,
              each hoping that this would be the one that would make me feel
              whole. But the more I pursued these desires, the more empty I
              felt. It was a cycle of temporary pleasure followed by lasting
              emptiness, and I couldn’t seem to escape it.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              Not long after, I joined a group that held a different
              perspective. Initially, I had difficulty connecting with them
              because of my conflicting views. Despite this, they chose me as
              their leader, a role I resisted because I was focused on
              satisfying my own desires. We had disagreements, and at one point
              I even suggested disbanding the group. Surprisingly, they did not
              respond with anger. Instead, they guided me through methods to
              deal with my lustful thoughts. Although it was difficult to change
              long-standing habits, I eventually adopted their approach and
              found it to be truly transformative.

            <p class="desc lv1">
              Now, desire no longer rules my life; I am my own master. I have
              mastered the art of knowing what is most important in
              life—authentic relationships and living up to my own moral
              expectations. This change has brought me more joy than ever
              before.

              For years, I allowed laziness to dictate my life, indulging in
              endless procrastination and avoiding the responsibilities that
              loomed over me. I preferred comfort and ease over the challenges
              that could have pushed me to grow. The more I gave in to this
              vice, the harder it became to break free. Initially, the lack of
              effort felt like a small indulgence, a way to escape the pressures
              of life. But as time passed, this laziness began to consume me,
              leading to missed opportunities, unfulfilled dreams, and a growing
              sense of dissatisfaction with my life. Despite the nagging guilt
              and the small voice in my head urging me to change, I found it
              easier to retreat further into my lethargy. I tried my best to
              ignore the consequences of my inaction, convincing myself that
              tomorrow would be different. But with each passing day, I slipped
              further into a cycle of avoidance and regret.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              One evening, as I sat alone in my cluttered room, surrounded by
              the remnants of tasks left undone, I was struck by a sudden
              realization: "Everything in life depends on how that life accepts
              its limits." I had been so focused on avoiding discomfort that I
              failed to recognize the importance of pushing beyond my own
              self-imposed boundaries. In that moment, I understood that
              laziness had become my prison, and the key to escaping it lay in
              accepting the responsibility for my own life. I began to take
              small steps, setting manageable goals and forcing myself to follow
              through, even when it felt uncomfortable. I learned to accept that
              growth required effort and that avoiding challenges only led to
              stagnation. As I slowly broke free from the grip of laziness, I
              discovered a newfound sense of purpose and fulfillment. Life
              became richer and more rewarding as I embraced the value of hard
              work and perseverance. In the end, learning to overcome laziness
              was not just about breaking a bad habit; it was about reclaiming
              my life and realizing that true satisfaction comes from embracing
              the effort it takes to achieve our goals.

            </div>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              When I was in secondary school, I developed an unsettling belief
              that I was the center of the entire world. With the ability to
              learn things quickly and excel in most subjects without much
              effort, I became convinced that I was a genius, perhaps even
              someone destined for greatness. This belief fed my arrogance, and
              I started to act like a jerk, dismissing others as inferior and
              irrelevant. I would correct teachers in class, scoff at my
              classmates' mistakes, and brush off anyone who dared challenge me.
              I truly believed that I was special, that the world revolved
              around me, and that everyone else was just too slow to keep up.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              This delusion of grandeur persisted until I met someone who
              shattered my inflated self-image. He was a new student, quiet and
              unassuming, but when he spoke or worked, his brilliance was
              undeniable. He solved problems faster than I could, asked
              questions that I hadn’t even considered, and effortlessly grasped
              concepts that I had struggled with. Watching him, I felt my
              arrogance begin to crumble. For the first time, I realized that I
              wasn’t the smartest person in the room, let alone the world. My
              confidence, once so unshakable, turned into doubt.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              Confronted with someone who was clearly better than me, I had no
              choice but to accept the harsh truth: I was not the center of the
              world. It was a humbling experience, one that forced me to
              reevaluate not only my abilities but also my attitude. I began to
              understand that true genius wasn’t just about being smart or quick
              to learn; it was about humility, curiosity, and the willingness to
              keep growing. The realization was a bitter pill to swallow, but it
              marked the beginning of a much-needed change in me. I learned that
              the world is far bigger than my own ego, and that there are always
              people out there who can teach me something new. In the end,
              meeting someone better than me was the best thing that could have
              happened; it pulled me out of my arrogance and set me on a path
              toward genuine self-improvement.

            </div>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              I used to be the kind of person who let envy dictate how I lived
              my life. Whenever I saw other people achieving great things in
              their life, I couldn't help but feel envious. This included not
              just milestones like birthdays and graduations, but also instances
              when I got to play video games with their beloved characters. I
              didn't realise it at the time, but I felt that their success was
              primarily due to luck, as if it were somehow related to me. I
              chose to be envious because I focused on what I lacked rather than
              proud of what I had achieved. This not only caused me to lose
              several relationships over time, but it also changed who I am.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              But when I joined this special group of people, things started to
              shift. Even though I was in the company of kind and supportive
              individuals, I realised that I had been making mistakes before and
              was still making them now. Since every person making a life
              transition will be different from everyone else while yet sharing
              some similarities, there is no one best way to go. Life is full of
              problems and difficulties, and everyone deals with them in their
              own unique manner. You can't go wrong by taking any other course
              of action. After a long period of time had gone, I started to
              appreciate parts of myself, like other people's achievements and
              happiness, and the emotions of jealousy started to go away.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              From the moment I first began to see the world, my viewpoint has
              changed considerably. Jealousy no longer drives me because I've
              realised that being successful is all about wanting to grow, both
              personally and in terms of helping other people do the same. I
              will be forever grateful to this community for helping me become a
              more complete person.
