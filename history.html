              Our journey begin at the moment that we arrived at the information
              technology department for the very first time, we immediately
              gathered together and formed a collaborative group. To begin, our
              first purpose was to complete the POSE assignment, which stands
              for Principles of Software Engineering. This was our initial
              objective. In addition, it was the very first time that we had
              ever before had challenges associated with passing the subject
              matter that was being considered. Due to a lack of talent, we have
              been presented with a myriad of problems, particularly in the
              fields of team working, knowledge, labour, and leisure. These
              problems have arisen as a direct consequence of the deficit of
              talent. We did not pay any attention to the lecture, and we did
              not begin working on the assignment until it was very near to the
              time that it was due. In addition, we did not pay any attention
              even to the lecture. The conclusion that we reached was that we
              had made a mistake. Due to the fact that the results of the exam
              left us feeling so disheartened, we made the decision to pursue
              additional schooling after we had finished the test.

              Since we hadn’t known how to work as a group, so we didn’t even
              give our group a name. The time come when we attent to “Working in
              group” lectures, at the first thing ever the teacher told us to do
              is making a team. We easily gatther around and again, froming a
              team. The interesting part is when the teacher told us introduce
              ourself to the class, which included our name, sologan. You might
              guess it, we struggled to choose and pick up a name for our group
              too. Thành, a member of our group have one-sided pick “Sciocoo” as
              our group’s team. We believed he was making fun of us until he
              explained why he felt "Sciocoo" was the best name for us; until
              then, we didn't understand what he meant when he stated it meant
              dumb in Italy.
